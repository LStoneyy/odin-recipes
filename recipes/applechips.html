    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Apple chips are a delectable snack made from thinly sliced apples that are
      typically baked until they achieve a crisp and crunchy texture. These
      chips offer a delightful blend of natural sweetness and a satisfying
      crunch, making them a healthier alternative to traditional potato chips.
      Often seasoned with various spices or left unadorned to highlight the
      fruit's inherent flavor, apple chips provide a convenient way to enjoy the
      essence of apples in a portable and crispy form.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Golden Delicious apples, cored and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1.5 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Arrange apple slices in a single layer on a metal baking sheet.</li>
      <li>
        Mix together sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over apple
        slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until apples are dried and edges curl, 45
        minutes to 1 hour. Use a metal spatula to transfer chips to a wire rack
        until cool and crispy.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>
      Slice apples using the slicing blade of a food processor or mandoline. If
      desired, you can flip the apple slices halfway through baking and sprinkle
      them with more cinnamon sugar.
