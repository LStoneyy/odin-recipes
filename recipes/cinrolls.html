    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cinnamon rolls are delectable pastries characterized by their soft, doughy
      layers swirled with a fragrant mixture of cinnamon, sugar, and butter.
      These treats are often baked until golden brown, producing a caramelized
      exterior that contrasts with their tender interior. Cinnamon rolls are
      typically topped with a luscious glaze or cream cheese frosting that adds
      a touch of sweetness to balance the warming spice. Whether enjoyed for
      breakfast, as a comforting snack, or even as a dessert, these rolls are a
      beloved comfort food that fills the air with an irresistible aroma as they
      bake.

      </li>
      <li>
        To make the dough: Whisk flour, 2 tablespoons white sugar, baking

        butter into flour mixture using your hands.
