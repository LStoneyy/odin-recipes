    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar and margarine in a large bowl with an electric mixer until
        smooth. Beat first egg into butter mixture. Beat second egg into mixture
        along with vanilla extract; add flour mixture and stir until dough is
        just combined. Wrap dough; chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two cookie
        sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out dough on a clean floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out
        shapes using cookie cutters; arrange them on the prepared cookie sheets.
        Gather scraps and repeat this step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in batches in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 6 to
        8 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet briefly before removing to a wire
        rack to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>What makes these cookies so soft?</h3>
    <p>
      There are a few reasons this recipe results in pillowy soft Christmas
      cookies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A teaspoon of baking powder helps the cookies rise during baking, which
        creates a fluffy texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        This recipe calls for margarine instead of butter because margarine
        doesn't spread as much during baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Two whole eggs add tons of moisture, keeping the cookies nice and
        tender.
      </li>
    </ul>
