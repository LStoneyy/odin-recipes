# odin-recipes

Welcome to our basic recipe website, the culmination of your HTML journey! In this project, we've harnessed all the knowledge you've acquired to construct a platform that celebrates the essence of cooking. Our website boasts a main index page, seamlessly connecting you to a curated collection of recipes that promise to tantalize your taste buds. While the aesthetics might lean towards the realm of brutalist web design - an acquired taste in itself - the focus here is on functionality and the art of HTML. So, whether you're a coding enthusiast or a culinary aficionado, join us on this web adventure where HTML expertise meets the culinary arts.

In this recipe site, we will show three recipes for culinary snacks! These include cinnamon rolls, christmas cookies, and apple chips!
